PEGASUS is a state-of-the-art model specifically designed for abstractive text summarization. It uses a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture optimized for generating fluent summaries by leveraging a unique pre-training technique called **gap-sentence generation**. Here's an overview of how PEGASUS works:

### Overview
- **Type**: Encoder-Decoder Model
- **Architecture**: Transformer-based structure that processes input text with an encoder to capture context and a decoder to generate summaries.
- **Purpose**: Designed primarily for abstractive summarization, where the model generates new sentences based on understanding the content and context of the original text.

### Key Features
- **Gap-Sentence Generation**: During pre-training, PEGASUS masks entire sentences (gap sentences) in the input and trains the model to generate these as part of the summary, teaching it to understand which sentences are most relevant.
- **Fluency and Coherence**: The model is optimized to create coherent and fluent summaries, making it ideal for summarizing detailed documents like scientific papers or news articles.

## FLAN-T5 Model for Text Summarization

The **FLAN-T5** model is a fine-tuned version of the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model, designed for efficient and high-quality text summarization tasks. FLAN-T5 incorporates instruction fine-tuning, enabling it to generalize better across different NLP tasks. In this project, the model is specifically trained on the 'pubmed-summarization' dataset to generate concise summaries for biomedical texts.

### Features
- **Instruction Fine-tuning**: Improves performance on diverse summarization tasks by following specific instructions.
- **Scalability**: Capable of handling varying lengths and complexities of text input.
- **High-Quality Summarization**: Generates summaries that are coherent and retain the essential information.
